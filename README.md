# L2G
Lion 2nd Generation "L2G" is a custom firmware for prototyping a Smart Home Router. Smart Home technology is growing rapidly in this generation. Connectivity solutions are being derived to interconnect home systems in ways that could only be imagined by our previous generations. This is all aimed toward a goal to create a network of all devices called the Internet of Things (IoT). This network extends to a diverse number of systems in a Smart Home environment, the number of connected devices continues to increase as new system prototypes are introduced every day and is estimated to increase from approximately 9 billion today, to more than 24 billion in the year 2020. This project aims to provide research toward the Design and Implementation of a Smart Home router based on the Intel® Galileo Gen2 programmable platform to support intelligent home wireless networking and provide connectivity solutions for the Internet of Things using Wi-Fi and another cutting edge wireless communication technology, "Bluetooth Low Energy" (BLE or Bluetooth® Smart).
